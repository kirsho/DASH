**Methylator** performs DNA methylation secondary analyses of [Bisulfite sequenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing) DNA samples. It is developped at the [BiBs](https://parisepigenetics.github.io/umr7216bioinfofacility/) plateform of [UMR7216 - Paris Epigenetics](http://parisepigenetics.com/) unit by Olivier Kirsh. An integration within a snakemake workflow is under development with the help of Magali Hennion.
